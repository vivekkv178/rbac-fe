Looking to manage user roles and permissions with precision and control? Our Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system is designed to give you powerful management over user access in your applications. With modern technology and a user-friendly interface, we offer a comprehensive set of features to handle user authentication and authorization.

**Key Features:**

1. **Sign Up:** Easily onboard new users with a secure registration process. Manage role assignment from the start.

2. **Sign In:** Authenticate users through a robust, secure login system to ensure access only to authorized individuals.

3. **Manage Users - List, Add, Read, Update, Delete:**
   - **List:** View all users in the system.
   - **Add:** Add new users with specific role assignments.
   - **Read:** Retrieve detailed information about individual users, including their permissions and roles.
   - **Update:** Modify user roles or permissions to reflect changes in access levels.
   - **Delete:** Remove users and revoke access efficiently.

This platform is built for flexibility, scalability, and security, ensuring that your applications have the right access control mechanism in place to grow as your user base and complexity increase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js (version 20 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vivekkv178/rbac-fe.git
   cd rbac-fe
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **.npmrc File (Only if Step 2 fails)**

   To install the component library, create a `.npmrc` file in the root of your project with the following content:

   > **Important:** The component library is private for now. To access it, you will need a temporary token. Please contact me to obtain the temporary token.

   ```plaintext
   registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
   @vivekkv178:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
   //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_TEMPORARY_TOKEN
   ```

### Configuration

Make sure to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the necessary configurations.

#### Frontend Environment Variables

> **Note:** The Firebase environment variables are not actually used in this application but are required for the component library to start, so some dummy values for it will suffice.
