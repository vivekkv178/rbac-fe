# Tech Stack Overview: Powering the RBAC Application

Uncover the technology that drives our Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) application, meticulously crafted to deliver security, performance, and a seamless user experience. Explore the robust tech stack that underpins our platform:

1. **Next.js:** Our frontend is powered by Next.js, an advanced React framework that facilitates rapid development and dynamic user interfaces. With features like server-side rendering and static site generation, Next.js ensures optimal performance and SEO, creating a fluid and engaging experience for users managing roles and permissions.

2. **Nest.js:** At the core of our backend lies Nest.js, a progressive Node.js framework. Nest.js's modular architecture allows for scalable development, while its built-in support for dependency injection and middleware simplifies the implementation of complex RBAC features, such as user management and role assignments.

3. **MongoDB:** For data storage, we utilize MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database. MongoDB's document-oriented structure allows for efficient data management and retrieval, perfectly suited for handling user roles and permissions in a dynamic environment. Its capability to store JSON-like documents aligns seamlessly with our applicationâ€™s requirements.

4. **TypeScript:** Enhancing our development process, TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that improves code quality and maintainability. With its type safety and advanced tooling, TypeScript helps prevent errors early in development, ensuring a smooth implementation of RBAC functionalities across the application.
