## Key Actions:

### 1. **User Registration (Sign Up):**

- The **User** fills in the sign-up form and submits it.
- The **Front-End (FE) App** triggers the sign-up API with the user data.
- The **Back-End (BE) App** processes the request and creates a new user in the **Database**.
- The **BE App** generates an authentication token and sends it back to the **FE App**.
- The **FE App** stores the token in a cookie and redirects the user to the home page.

### 2. **User Management (CRUD Operations):**

- The **User** accesses the "Manage Users" page (if they have the appropriate permissions).
- The **User** performs actions like adding, editing, or deleting a user.
- The **FE App** sends the corresponding API request to the **BE App**.
- The **BE App** processes the request and updates the **Database** accordingly.

### 3. **User Logout:**

- The **User** logs out of the application.
- The **FE App** deletes the authentication token from the cookies and redirects the user to the login page.

### 4. **User Login (Sign In):**

- The **User** enters their login credentials (email and password) on the login page.
- The **FE App** triggers the login API, sending the credentials to the **BE App**.
- The **BE App** verifies the credentials and checks the user's role and permissions.
- Upon successful authentication, the **BE App** generates a new token and returns it to the **FE App**.
- The **FE App** stores the token in a cookie and redirects the user to the home page, granting access based on their role.
