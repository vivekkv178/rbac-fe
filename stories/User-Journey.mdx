## User Journey Steps

1. **Start**:

   - The user initiates interaction with the application.

   - The user is presented with three options:
     - **Sign Up**: Proceed to the registration process.
     - **Sign In**: Access an existing account.
     - **Logout**: Exit the application if the user is already logged in.

3. **User Registration (Sign Up)**:

   - If the user selects **Sign Up**:
     - The user accesses the registration page.
     - Fills out the registration form with required information.
     - Submits the form to create an account.
     - An API call is made to save user data in the database.
     - On successful registration, user is redirected to home page.

4. **Sign In**:

   - If the user selects **Sign In**:
     - The user navigates to the login page.
     - Inputs credentials (username and password) and submits the sign-in form.
     - An API call verifies the credentials.
     - On successful authentication, a token is generated and stored in cookies.

     - **Logout**: The user can log out by clicking the logout button, which returns them to the login page.

6. **Logout Process**:

   - If the user selects **Logout** at any point:
     - The token is removed from cookies.
     - The user is redirected to the login page.

7. **Admin Functionality** (if the user has admin privileges):

   - The admin can:
     - **View Users**: See a list of all users.
