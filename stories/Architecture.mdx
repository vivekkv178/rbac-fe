### Key Components:

The architecture of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) application is designed to effectively manage user roles and permissions. Key components include:

1. **Frontend**:

   - Developed using **Next.js**, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation.
   - Deployed on **Vercel**, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.

2. **Backend**:

   - Built with **NestJS**, a progressive Node.js framework that promotes modular architecture and efficient code organization.
   - Implements RESTful APIs for handling user authentication, role assignments, and permission checks.
   - Incorporates **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication and session management.

3. **Database**:
   - Utilizes **MongoDB** for data storage, with **MongoDB Atlas** serving as the cloud-hosted version, allowing for managed database services.
